# Arduino-uno-LDR-photo-resistor-module
The Arduino Uno LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) Photo Resistor Module detects changes in light intensity. It typically includes an LDR sensor whose resistance changes based on the amount of light it receives. Used in light-sensitive projects like streetlights, security systems, and automatic brightness control for displays.
